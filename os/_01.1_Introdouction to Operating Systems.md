## __01.1.5 Design Goals__
- Easy to use
- Efficient
- Stable

--------------------------------------------------

## __01.1.6 Characteristic of an OS__
### An OS is a program
- with a `main()` function, but only gets called once during boot
- That consumes resources and can generate exceptions
### An OS is an unusual program
- does not terminate (infinite loop)
- only responses to external events
- does not have a single thread of control - can be invoked by more than one event.
### Overhead
- Refers to the extra resources (such as time, memory, processing power, or network bandwidth) consumed by various system tasks and operations that are necessary for the proper functioning of the system but do not directly contribute to the primary task or application being executed by the user.
