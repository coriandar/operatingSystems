# _03.2: Process Related System Calls_
## __03.2.1 POSIX__
- `POSIX`: Portable Operating System Interface
- An industry standard.
- Modern OSes are POSIX compliant
- Four parts:
    - Core services
    - Real-time extensions
    - Thread extensions
    - Shell and utilities
--------------------------------------------------
## __03.2.2 Process Related System Calls__
### Recall
- System call transfers execution to kernal mode.
- Kernal mode executes at a higher privilege level.
- Sensitive operations are only allowed in kernal mode.

### Process related system calls
- There are many variants of these system calls with diff args:
    - fork()
    - wait()
    - exec()
    - exit()

--------------------------------------------------
## __03.2.3 fork()__
- Function: creates a child process
- All processes are created by forking from parent.
- The `init` process is the ancestor of all processes.
- 2^n - 1 = number of processes after fork, n = forks. Excludes parent.

```java
             |
             |   +--------+
             |   | Parent | // same as before
+--------+   |   +--------+
| Parent |   |
+--------+   |   +--------+
             |   | Child  | // copy of parent
             |   +--------+ // a new process
             |
before fork  |   After fork
```

### Process ID
- Parent program calls fork();
- Each process is assigned a `unique` Process ID by the OS when it is first created.
- Execution of both parent and child processes will continue from the statement after `fork()`

### Process Creation
- Returns process ID of child.
- Every process is uniquely identified byt its process ID.

```c
int main() {
    printf("hello world (pid:%d)\n", (int) getpid()); // get = system call
    int rc = forl();

    // execution of both parent and child (if successful) continues from here.
    if (rc < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    // fork succeeded, now 2 copies of same program
    else if (rc == 0) { // child process
        printf("hello, I am child (pid:%d)\n", (int) getpid());
    }
    else { // parent process
        printf("hello, I am parent of %d (pid:%d)\n", rc, (int) getpid());
    }
    return 0;
}

/**
hello world (pid:29146)
hello, I am parent of 29152 (pid:29146)
hello, I am child (pid:29152)
*/
```
--------------------------------------------------
## __03.2.4 exec()__
- Causes a process to execute a given executable.
- After fork, parent and child are running the same code.
- Running `exec()` will load another executable to its allocated memory.
- Note that exec() NEVER `returns`.
```c
int main() {
    printf("hello world (pid:%d)\n", (int) getpid());
    int rc = fork();
    if (rc < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    else if (rc = 0) {
        printf("hello, I am child (pid:%d)\n", (int) getpid());
        char *myargs[3];
        myargs[0] = strdup("wc"); // execute this program
        myargs[1] = strdup("p3.c"); // with this arguement
        myargs[2] = NULL;
        execvp(myargs[0], myargs);
        printf("This shouldn't print out"); // exec() doesn't return
    }
    else { // parent will exec this
        int nc = wait(NULL);
        printf("hello, I am parent of %d (wait:%d) (pid:%d)\n", rc, nc, (int) getpid());
    }

    return 0;
}

/**
hello world (pid:29146)
hello, I am child (pid:29152)
29      107     1030    p3.c // output of wc p3.c
hello, I am parent of 29152 (pid:29146)
*/
```
--------------------------------------------------
## __03.2.5 exit()__
- Terminates a process.
- Automatically called when end of `main()` is reached.
- Terminated process exists as a zombie.
- Zombie process is cleaned up by `wait()`
--------------------------------------------------
## __03.2.6 wait()__
- Causes a parent to block until child terminates.
- When parent calls `wait()`, zombie child is cleaned up.
- Alternatively, `waitpid()` may be used to wait for a process with a specified PID.
- If parent does not call wait(), child remains a zombie.
- Parent terminates before child, child becomes orphan, can be adopted by init process.
--------------------------------------------------
## __03.2.7 Shell__
- Text-based interface to OS.
- Executes built-in commands and programs that you enter at prompt.
- `init` process spawns a shell.
- Most common shells:
    - Bourne Shell(sh)
    - Bourne Again Shell(bash)
    - POSIX Shell(sh)
    - C Shell(csh)

### How does it work?
1. Reads user command.
2. `fork()` a child process.
3. `exec()` the command executable.
4. Wait for command to finish.
5. Repeat from step 1.

```java
▲ ▼
   +-------+
   | init  |
   +-------+
fork() |
       | exec()
       ▼
   +-------+
   |  sh   | <----
   +-------+      |
fork() |          |
exec() |   exit() |
       ▼          |
   +-------+      |
   | prog  | -----
   +-------+
     |    |
     |    |
     ▼    ▼
Other child processes
```

### Not all commands are process forked by shell
- Consider `cd`, if it were executed in a child process, the current dir of parent will remain the same.
- Needs to be a built in command.
