# _05.1: Virutal Address_
## __05.1.1 Virtualizing Memory__
### Virtualizing the CPU
- Creates illusion that a process has own CPU

### Virtualizing the Memory
- Creates illusion that a process has access to all the memory.
- Virtual address -> Physical address translation
- Need be:
    - Transparent to the program
    - Efficient
    - Provide protection
--------------------------------------------------
## __05.1.2 Address Translation__
```java
Virutal address                 Physcial adress
+-------+ ---                  +-----------+
| Stack |    |                 | OS Kernal |
+-------+    |                 +-----------+
| Heap  |    | Addr trans      | Free mem  |
+-------+    |<-------         |           |
| Data  |    |        |        +-----------+
+-------+    |        |        | Process C |
| Code  |    |        |        +-----------+
+-------+ ---          ------> | Process D |
                               +-----------+
```
--------------------------------------------------
## __05.1.3 Segmentation__
- Good for big programs.
- Seperate virtual addr space of a process into several `logical segments`
- At least 3 logical: `code + static data`, `stack`, `heap`
- Each segment could be located in different parts of physical memory.
- Better chance of finding a large enough memory `hole` to fit the segments.
- More complex to manage - need hardware support `MMU`

### Hardare Support (Memory Management Unit)
- Maintains a page table that maps virutal addresses to physical addresses.
