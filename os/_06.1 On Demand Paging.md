    - Parent process is copied to the area of memory allocated to the child process.
- exec() is called by the child process:
    - Memory allocated to the original child process is freed.
    - Memory allocated for the program specified in exec() and process pagetable updated.
    - Program is loaded from file to the allocated memory.
