# _06.2: Virtual Memory_
## __06.2.1 Demand Paging__
- Load pages to physical memory only when needed.
- Allocate a `swap space` on disk for pages that are swapped out from memory.
- Reserce a bit on the page table to indicate if a page is in memory (`valid` or `present` bit)
--------------------------------------------------
## __06.2.2 Page Fault__
- Trying to access a page that is not in memory.
- Invokes `page-fault handler`
- Maintains a free-frame list.
- List must be regularly re-populated.
--------------------------------------------------
## __06.2.3 When Memory is Full__
- Need swap page out of memory before loading a page. (page replacement)
- Page-replacement Policy - process of selecting a page to swap out from memory.
- OS usually set a `low watermark` (LW) and `high watermark` (HW)
- A background thread, `swap daemon`, starts swapping out pages from mempry when LW free pages are left until HW free pages are available.
--------------------------------------------------
## __06.2.4 Page Replacement Policies__
- Page faults number of swaps.

### Optimal Replacement Policy
- The best.
- Difficult to implement in practice.
- Use a baseline to compare other policies.
- Throw out the page that is required furtherest away in time.

### FIFO
- Easy to implement.
- FIFO queue.
- Not very efficient.

### LRU (Least recently used)
- User past knowledge instead of future knowledge like optimal policy.
