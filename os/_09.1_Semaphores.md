# _09.1: Semaphores_
## __09.1.1 Definition__
- Integer variable shared among processes/thread for synchronization purposes.
- Must be initialized when created.
- Cannot directly read its current value.
- Only allows or increment and decrement.
- Decrement before entering critical section, increment after critical.
- Allowed to proceed only if `returned value >= 0` after decrementing.
--------------------------------------------------
## __09.1.2 Associated Functions__
### Up/post/signal/V
- Increments the semaphore by 1.
- Wake up one of the processes waiting on the semaphore.

### Down/wait/P
- Decrements the semaphore by 1.
- Thread will wait (sleep or block) if counter is negative.
--------------------------------------------------
## __09.1.3 Implications__
- Cannot know whether a thread will block `before` decrementing a semaphore.
- After thread increments a semaphore and another thread gets woken up, both threads run concurrently - cannot know which thread will continue immediately.
--------------------------------------------------
## __09.1.4 Binary Semaphore__
- Initial value is 1.
- Equivalent to a lock (mutex)
--------------------------------------------------
## __09.1.7 Why Semaphores?__
- Impose `deliberate constraints` that help programmers avoid errors.
- Solutions are often `cleaner` and `more organized`, making it easier to demonstrate correctness.
- Semaphores can be implemented easily, making solutions that use semaphores `portable`.
--------------------------------------------------
## __09.1.8 Producer-Consumer Problem__
### Two different threads/processes:
#### Producer
- Writes data into a shared buffer.

#### Consumer
- Reads from the shared buffer

### Requirements
- Producer and consumer cannot access the buffer simultaneously.
- Producer never overwrites the data buffer unless the data have been read by the consumer.
- Consumer only reads data if there is unread data in buffer.
--------------------------------------------------
## __09.1.9 Finite Buffer Producer-Consumer Problem__
### Problem
- Need two semaphores for signalling
    - Track available slots: make producer wait if no more empty slots.
    - Track filled slots: make consumer wait if there is no filled slot.
- One semaphore to act as `mutex` for the buffer
```c
spaces = Semaphore(MAX); // tracks avail. space in buffer
items = Semaphore(0);
mutex = Semaphore(1);
```

### Solution
#### Producer
```c
sema_down(spaces);
sema_down(mutex);
    // add item to buffer
sema_up(mutex);
sema_up(items);
```

#### Consumer
```c
sema_down(items);
sema_down(mutex);
    // get item from buffer
sema_up(mutex);
sema_up(spaces);
```
--------------------------------------------------
## __09.1.10 Reader/Writer Problem__
### Problem
- Theads that only want to `read` a shared data structure may be treated differently from one that want to `modify` (writing to) it
    - Any number of readers can be in the critical section simultaneously.
    - Writers must have exclusive access to the critical section.
    - `A writer cannot enter critical section while another (reader/writer) is there`

### Solution
```c
// implement a read-write-lock
int readers = 0;
mutex = Semaphore(1); // to protect readers
roomEmpty = Semaphore(1);
```
--------------------------------------------------
## __09.1.11 Lightswitch Pattern__
1. First one entering a room, turns on light. (`lock mutex`)
2. Last one leaving a room, turns off light. (`unlock mutex`)

### Shorthand
```c
m = Lightswitch();
m_lock(mutex);
m_unlock(mutex);
```
--------------------------------------------------
## __09.1.12 Starvation__
### Problem
- If there is a continuous stream of readers, a writer may have to wait forever.
- A writer cannot execute as long as there is at least one reader in the room.

### Solution
```c
// locks when first reader enter and unlocks when last reader exits
roomEmpty = Semaphore(1); 

// When there is a writer waiting, do not allow any more readers to enter.
turnstile = Semaphore(1);

// keeps track of how many readers are in the room.
readSwitch = Lightswitch();
```

#### Writer
```c
sema_down(turnstile);
sema_down(roomEmpty);
    // Critical Section for writer
sema_up(turnstile);
sema_up(roomEmpty);
```

#### Reader
```c
sema_down(roomEmpty);
sema_up(turnstile);

readSwitch_lock(roomEmpty);
    // Critical Section for reader
readSwitch_unlock(roomEmpty);
```
