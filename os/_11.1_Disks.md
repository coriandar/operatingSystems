# _11.1: Hard Disk Internals_
## __11.1.1 Basic Geometry__
- Typical rotation between 7200 and 15000 RPM
- Accessng two sectors that are near each other is faster than accessing two that are far apart.
--------------------------------------------------
## __11.1.2 Rotation Delay__
- If `R` is the time for a full rotation, the average rotation delay is `R/2`
--------------------------------------------------
## __11.1.3 Seek Time and Track Skew__
- `Seek time` = Time to move the disk head over the right track.
- Starting block on each track off by two (`Track skew`), to minimize time for consecutive sector read/write
--------------------------------------------------
## __11.1.4 Multi-zone__
- More sectors in this zone than the inner one.
--------------------------------------------------
## __11.1.5 Cache (Track Buffer)__
- Typically 8 or 16mb
- Hold data read from or written to disk.
- Allow the drive to quickly respond to requests.
### Write-Back
- Acknowlege the write has completed when it has put the data in its memory.

### Write-Through
- Acknowlege after the write has actually been written to disk.

--------------------------------------------------
## __11.1.6 Disk Structure__
- Address as one large array of `logical blocks`
    - Formatting creates the logical blocks.
- Logical blocks are mapped onto the sectors of disk sequentially.
    - Sector 0 is first sector of outermost track.
    - Mapping starts from outermost to innermost track.
--------------------------------------------------
## __11.1.7 I/O Time__
### I/O Time
`T(I/O) = T(seek) + T(rotation) + T(transfer)`

### Rate of I/O
`R(I/O) = Size(Transfer) / T(I/O)`

--------------------------------------------------
## __11.1.8 HDD Scheduling__
- OS is responsible for using the hardware efficiently.
```
Fast access time = minimize seek time.
Disk bandwidth = 
                     Total number of bytes transferred
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Time of completion of last transfer - time of first request for service
```
--------------------------------------------------
## __11.1.9 FCFS__
- `SSTF`: Shortest Seek Time First
- A form of SJF can cause starvation.
--------------------------------------------------
## __11.1.10 SCAN__
### Algorithm
- Arm starts at one end of the disk.
- Arm moves towards the otehr end, servicing requests.
- Arm reached the other end of disk, move back in other direction.
- Each pass from on end to the other end is called a `sweep`
--------------------------------------------------
## __11.1.11 C-SCAN__
- `Sweep` in only one direction
- When the arm reaches the end, it moved back to the start without servicing requests.
- Provides more unifrom wait time.
--------------------------------------------------
## __11.1.12 I/O Merging__
- Merging requests into more efficient requests by waiting.
--------------------------------------------------
## __11.1.13 Practical Disk Scheduling__
- SCAN and C-SCAN performs better for systems with high disk access demands.
--------------------------------------------------
## __11.1.14 Deadline Scheduler__
- Linux implements deadline scheduler.
- Maintains seperate read and write queues, gives read priority.
- Implements both FCFS and C-SCAN.
- I/O requests sent in batches.
- After each batch, checks if any request in FCFS older than  pre-determined age.
- If so, the C-SCAN queue containing that batch is selected.
